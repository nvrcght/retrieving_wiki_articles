# retrieving_wiki_articles
*(Based on materials prepared for Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach, Coursera by University of Washington).*

Using nearest neighbors and clustering to retrieve documents that interest users, 
by analyzing their text. Exploring two document representations: word counts and TF-IDF. 
Building iPython notebook for retrieving articles from Wikipedia about famous people.


####Outcome:

-Executing document retrieval code with the iPython notebook  
-Loading and transforming real text data  
-Comparing results with word counts and TF-IDF  
-Setting the distance function in the retrieval  
-Building a document retrieval model using nearest neighbor search
