# retrieving_wiki_articles
*(Based on materials prepared for Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach, Coursera by University of Washington).

Using nearest neighbors and clustering to retrieve documents that interest users, 
by analyzing their text. Exploring two document representations: word counts and TF-IDF. 
We also built an iPython notebook for retrieving articles from Wikipedia about famous people.

 explore the retrieval results for various famous people, 


Learning outcomes
